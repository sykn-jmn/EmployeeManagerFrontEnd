# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.7.

## Lessons

### CORS Configuration
Connected the Front End to Back End which I was unable to do before.
It turns out that you need CORS configuration because of modern browsers.

### BootStrap Modals
It is very easy. just copy and paste code and edit a little. I hope I can do it again without tutorial flawlessly
